# Cloud Development Platform - Exercise Two

## Project Overview
This project automates the deployment of a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host a simple Apache-based web server. The deployment is scripted using Bash and aligns with the infrastructure specifications from Exercise Two of the Cloud Development Platform assignment.

## Files Included
- `DeploymentScript.sh`: Deploys a VM with a static IP, opens firewall ports, and installs Apache to serve a "Hello World" page.
- `CleanupScript.sh`: Deletes all deployed resources to avoid unintended charges.

## Prerequisites
Before running the deployment or cleanup scripts, ensure the following:
- **Google Cloud SDK** is installed and initialized: `gcloud init`
- You are authenticated using your **personal Google account** (not a service account)
- Your account has **Editor** or **Compute Admin** IAM permissions on the GCP project
- Required GCP **APIs are enabled**, including:
  - Compute Engine API
  - IAM API (for managing permissions)
- A valid **billing account** is linked to your GCP project (Free Tier eligible)

## Deployment Specs (Per Assignment Requirements)
- **VM Configuration**: 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM
- **Boot Disk**: 250GB
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Web Server**: Apache2
- **Network**: Static external IP
- **Firewall Rules**: TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) open

## Free Tier Testing (For Cost Safety)
While the script is built to meet full assignment specs, testing was done using the following configuration to stay within Google Cloud Free Tier:
- **Machine Type**: e2-micro
- **Disk Size**: 10GB
- **Same startup script and configuration logic**

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or copy the scripts to your local machine.
2. Make sure the Google Cloud SDK is installed and initialized:
   ```bash
   gcloud init
   ```
3. Replace `your-project-id` in `DeploymentScript.sh` with your actual GCP project ID.
4. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x DeploymentScript.sh
   ./DeploymentScript.sh
   ```
5. Note the external IP printed by the script and visit it in your browser:
   ```
   http://<EXTERNAL_IP>
   ```

## Cleanup Instructions
To remove all GCP resources created by the deployment script:
```bash
chmod +x CleanupScript.sh
./CleanupScript.sh
```
This will delete:
- The VM instance
- The static IP address
- The firewall rule

## Screenshots for Submission
- Terminal showing successful deployment
- GCP Console showing the running VM instance
- SSH terminal into the VM
- Browser displaying the "Hello World" webpage

## Notes
- Initial web server setup may take 1â€“2 minutes after deployment
- Firewall rule allows both SSH and HTTP traffic
- No service account is attached to the VM to ensure proper control and avoid permission issues

This project was completed as part of the Cloud Development Platform module.
All scripts were tested on a Kali Linux VM using the Google Cloud SDK.
